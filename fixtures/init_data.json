But for a real-world application, you\u2019d probably want more flexibility and functionality in your websites.\r\n\r\nDjango offers lots of built-in options for using templates to make your site dynamic and flexible, and makes it easy for you to build the extra things you need. In this course, learn about more complex template inheritance, how to make use of the vast array of built-in tags and filters Django has, and how to grow your own tags and filters for the functionality that Django doesn\u2019t provide. By the time you finish this course, you will have a deeper understanding of how you can make Django\u2019s templates work for your project, as well as a fully fleshed out video tutorial site!",
